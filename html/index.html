    <h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      When you maintain an enterprise project with lots of subsystems and
      services you probably have several teams. Each team can work on one or
      more services or applications, have different capacity and seniority
      level. People from one team can be moved to another for many reasons:
      personal interests, communication, special knowledge or capacity needs and
      so on. Newcomers should be integrated into the development process as soon
      as possible to reduce time and cost, so you should find the shortest way
      of introduction not only into project terminology and functional
      requirements but into details of technical implementation as well. You may
      have skilled developers but internal and cross teams communication may
      essentially impact on development speed and quality. Your project will
      probably have a legacy which should have been upgraded a couple of years
      ago and external integrators from time to time will complain about unclear
      interfaces and request support thereby increasing the workload of the
      team. All these questions will bring you to the idea of technical and
      solution management in different teams. Highly likely, it depends on the
      size of your project, you will have a couple or even a team of architects
      to resolve challenges above. One of the goals of architectural runway is
      to provide standards for technology landscape and common patterns. In this
      article I tried to express my thoughts on five basic aspects which should
      be kept up-to-date for successful project maintenance and development.
    </p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">&uarr;</a></p>

    <h2><a name="application"></a>Application</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      If you have decided to build a technological foundation in your project
      the first topic in queue to review is your applications. Here are included
      all services which communicate with each other; end-user and
      administration interfaces (public and internal); custom tools for
      supporting data, infrastructure, development and testing processes. When
      you gather information about all implemented elements you will find
      technologies, approaches and techniques, patterns introduced by different
      team members.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Based on gathered information about technologies and practice evolution in
      general, you will be able to define core concepts for your future template
      application(s). This should be done on different levels: frameworks and
      libraries usage; application structure and internal configuration;
      implementation of generic functionality, e.g. logging, communication
      interfaces, basic validation, caching, etc; common concepts, for instance
      exception concept; design patterns. One of the important things here is to
      stop on time: not every good idea you have should be added to the core
      template. Sometimes it’s better to document it and provide an example of a
      good approach (e.g. you see a good approach of implementation of business
      rules checks: particular rules most likely shouldn’t be in template
      application so even good validation service implementation won’t make
      sense). We will come back to the documentation topic later.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Probably your template application at some stage will provide lots of
      important functionality. Here you should split it into a showcase
      application, modules (to simplify update process for teams) and template
      itself. This will help to keep the template clean from usage examples
      which should be deleted each time you clone it. While splitting modules
      don’t forget that it will bring you additional maintenance complexity. It
      depends on used technologies, organization and team structure and
      processes. Topic of structure and processes is out of scope of this
      article, but you also should think about it when introducing new
      technologies (e.g. the process of subscription and license approval will
      affect the speed of modern service or fancy library introduction into
      development process).
    </p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">&uarr;</a></p>

    <h2><a name="testing"></a>Testing</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      To keep high quality of your delivery you need a testing strategy. It’s
      rather hard to cover all aspects of a large system with manual review.
      With the growth of the project you will have to increase the QA team, find
      out and hold a ratio of developers to QA engineers. Tested area and its
      complexity can be changing on different phases of the project’s life
      cycle. There is a risk of overloading the QA team. To secure quality you
      have nothing to do but introduce automation. You can define your own
      strategy or apply any common one like testing pyramid. The main idea is to
      keep a clean and transparent understanding of process and structure.
      Automation will make your QA team’s life easier and comparison of
      regression and fiesta will sound less sarcastic.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      From a technical point of view you need to think about transparent
      metrics, tests classification, test framework, reporting and analytics
      tools which will be integrated in your ticketing system. You should
      provide your QA team development and configuration management support to
      prepare testing areas in your ecosystem. Only collaboration of these three
      can bring your team to clean processes and architecture. Each one of them
      will be a customer and implementer for two others at the same time. Based
      on the designed solution it will be possible to clarify and unify testing
      approaches in particular teams.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Overall testing process can be centralized or decentralized… or both at
      the same time on different levels, e.g. each subsystem can have its own
      testing processes but on level above you probably will need integration,
      E2E, load tests and data checks for the whole chain. There are four major
      points to think about: strong classification, unified processes,
      independent runs and results gathering. Presence of the first one is a
      basic condition. When you have your tests classified you will be able to
      exclude duplicates, optimize concept implementation and reduce overall
      testing time.
    </p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">&uarr;</a></p>

    <h2><a name="infrastructure"></a>Infrastructure</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      We use infrastructure every day and it can make the development process
      easier or vice versa turn it into hell. Everyone can take the best tools,
      services and hardware but those who can integrate them all together to
      provide a safe and reliable ecosystem for stable solution development are
      much less. Infrastructure provides a major impact on processes you have.
      Infrastructure is about communication between technical components, people
      and data.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      To provide developers benefits but not problems you should think about how
      they can maintain their code and documentation, manage environments, use
      external services and deliver value to end-users. Process of getting
      access to particular secure spaces should be clear and fast: who would
      like to wait weeks for access to a specific area when the development team
      becomes distributed? But at the same time it doesn’t mean that you should
      grant access to everyone from everywhere… You should support such
      practices like code review, static analysis, continuous integration and
      delivery — almost no modern project can live without it.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      From an exploitation point of view critical are data backup, security of
      public interfaces and monitoring. I guess you’ve already heard a joke
      about two types of administrators: those who don’t make backups yet and
      those who already do. When you maintain a bunch of components don’t forget
      to look after vulnerabilities reports and exploits distribution.
      Transforming one of your public services to a botnet spam node, for
      instance, is the most harmless thing that can happen. Set up metrics and
      alarms to prevent system outages.
    </p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">&uarr;</a></p>

    <h2><a name="configuration"></a>Configuration</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      Each element of your infrastructure needs to be carefully tuned and what
      is worth to think about is how to organize configuration update and
      rollback processes. Versioning of your configuration files and scripts
      probably will help you but it’s not enough — there should be an isolated
      space for configuration implementation and testing. Allocate some
      percentage of resources to increase reliability. This will work at least
      for two reasons: experiments with configurations won’t affect your working
      ecosystem and you will be able to apply changes only after getting
      successful results. Definitely, there are possible extreme cases when you
      don’t have an option because it’s almost impossible to duplicate
      everything.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      There are three major components on application level: configuration of
      application itself, environments configuration and processes
      configuration. First two are tightly linked and the third one provides a
      path to application distribution within your infrastructure. Developers
      know what to tune in their application and more or less can understand how
      to tune different components, but the exact values cannot be set up
      without configuration management team support. Probably you would like to
      include automation (and not only of course) testing to the distribution
      process here you definitely won’t be able to dispense with the QA team.
      Proper configuration will specify how to establish fast and clear delivery
      and help to comply with the nonfunctional requirements.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Different teams have different requirements for configuration according to
      their process and developed software specific. So most likely exactly the
      same automation of the distribution process cannot be applied, but common
      actions and helper functions can be combined to meet the need. Also you
      can provide some top level steps with hooks implementation and manual
      actions possibilities. Number of stages also can differ and here it should
      be clear how they should be mapped to other solution components.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>
    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">&uarr;</a></p>

    <p align="justify">
      The last but not least topic is documentation in a broad sense. All we are
      doing as developers is solving business problems and description of your
      work makes it transparent and reasonable for your customers. Documentation
      helps to clarify what tons of hours were paid for and why it was
      necessary. What matters is the benefits which business will get: costs
      reduction, faster delivery, higher quality — the classical triangle.
      Direct connection between your solution and the following positive impact
      should be shown in reports.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The technical audience of documentation should be able to find answers to
      the core question: Should we use the solution? It is quite a logical
      question when there are teams with already established development
      approaches. Don’t hesitate to provide clear instructions on approach usage
      and migrating existing code base and processes to new rails mixed with
      guidelines and common problems solutions description. Teams should
      understand the positive effects on their daily work they will get if they
      adopt the approach. Solution design specification will help you to find
      its weak points, involve engineers into improvement processes — get
      feedback and maybe support with development.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      It is worth to clarify rules and templates for documentation forms used on
      a daily basis such as: code documentation (self documented code usually
      exists only in imagination), specification of APIs and user stories,
      howtos. Sometimes teams should be pushed to adopt the ongoing documenting
      process to share experience, save knowledge and inform on usage of what
      they produce. It may be painful or not depending on the tools provided,
      fortunately, there is an abundance of them.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      Article does not and can not cover all possible aspects and scenarios, and
      you will definitely have your special case. Topics mentioned in the
      article are highly coupled. Changes in one area affect others which makes
      concepts implementation unique in each particular situation. Nevertheless
      common practices (like InnerSource for instance) and patterns can be
      found, adapted depending on demands, applied and integrated into daily
      activities to achieve results of successful project evolution. Of course
      smart architecture is not enough: amount of legacy code and its quality,
      team involvement and motivation, business readiness for improvements
      should be taken into account as well. Implementation looks like a
      complicated endless process and it is, but a journey of a thousand miles
      begins with the first step. Even small adjustments can make a team’s life
      a little bit easier.
